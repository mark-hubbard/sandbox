commands: "git pull origin master"command 
or use Fetch from GUI.
3. Create a branch "My-Topic-Branch"
work on the files off you created branch
make changes,
commit changes,
push changes (!use gui to do that)
  remember to select the list of the files that need

create a PULL ticket @ GITHUB
  Base = MASTER
  HEAD = My-Topic-Branch

4. (MARK) REVIEW Code
